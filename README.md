1022 - group project

Project Description:
The project our group has decided to make is a guessing game app. The app allows the user to enter their username, and pick a difficulty from 1 to 10, 1-50, and 1-100. The user is then asked to select the number of attempts they would like from a range of 5, 10, and 15. The user enters a guess, from the given range. Every correct guess, the screen displays that the user has guessed correctly, every incorrect guess the screen displays that the user has guessed incorrectly. After the user makes their last guess, the app will congratulate the user if their guess rate was 50% or above, or display “Better luck next time” if their guess rate was 49% or less. Lastly the app will ask the user if they want to play again.
